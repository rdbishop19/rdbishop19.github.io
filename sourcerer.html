		Journey of the Sourcerer
	</h1>
	<p>
		I have never met <strong>The Sourcerer</strong>, nor <strong>The Sourceress</strong>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I know not if they even have an earthly form. But their Path has been known since <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" target="_blank">January 1, 1970</a></del> before the Dawn of the Silicon Age.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Path, it divides<sup>exponentially</sup>, sending each new <strong>Command Line Wanderer</strong> on his or her own unique odyssey. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-transform: uppercase;">
		<strong>What <em>strange</em> magic must bewitch this place!</strong> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Mr. Frost had but only two roads between which to choose. Such Boolean triviality! But for the lone <strong>Digital Traveler</strong>, the choices are infinite, wrought with divergence at every step.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet... in the end, all of these Paths meet at a singular <del>terminal</del> destination. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of you know of this place. Others have found clues hinting its existence, ever pulling you forward in your Path in search of its true name.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Tis here, <strong><em>The Code Not Taken</em></strong>, where I find myself. Just as every traveler who has come before and every traveler yet to be.
	</p>
	<p>
		So join me, <strong>Fellow Friend</strong>, and I promise you a journey forged in Bugs, Sweat, and Tears.
