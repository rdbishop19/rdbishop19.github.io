                                '2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. 
                                The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them 
                                to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game 
                                after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)"> --Wikipedia </a>

"It was a way to pass the time", he said. The game is free to play, Cirulli having said that he was unwilling to make money from "something that [he] didn’t invent". He released a free app version of the game for iOS and Android in May 2014.')
